# pubcrawlers mock app

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

This app serves to showcase the implementation using webpacker and ES6 syntax of some of the most common features used by Le Wagon students in their projects.

It is not intended to be the holy grail in terms of how to implement these features, but merely a reference on how to move away from jQuery and the Asset Pipeline.

Live demo on here [https://pubcrawlerapp.herokuapp.com/]

## Getting started

After cloning the app, create the db, run the migration and seed.

```bash
$ rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

The seeds include addresses that will be geocoded. In order to take advantage of all of the features, make sure that all of the addresses were properly geocoded.

## Deploying to heroku

If deploying to heroku fails, it might be an issue with the webpacker version and you'll have to manually specify the heroku buildpacks:

```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:clear
$ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby
```

## Adding Google Maps

For the basic setup I recommend following Le Wagon's [geocoding lecture](https://kitt.lewagon.com/knowledge/lectures/05-Rails%2F08-Airbnb-Geocoder)

However, unlike the lecture setup, *map.js* is a component and goes in `app/javacript/components/`folder.

You can pass several options when creating the map, such as to disable `streetViewControl`, `mapTypeControl`and `scrollwheel`:

```javascript
const map = new GMaps({
  el: '#map',
  lat: 0, lng: 0,
  streetViewControl: false,
  mapTypeControl: false,
  scrollwheel:  false
});
```

To highlight markers when you over on their respective card, you need to add an event listener to each card and change the market the the event is fired:

```javascript
const cards = document.querySelectorAll('.card-row');
cards.forEach((card, index) => {
  const marker = mapMarkers[index];
  card.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
    marker.setIcon('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Concept211/Google-Maps-Markers/master/images/marker_blue.png');
  });
  card.addEventListener('mouseout', () => {
    marker.setIcon('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Concept211/Google-Maps-Markers/master/images/marker_red.png');
  });
})
```

## Adding a Favoriting System

A `user`can like/favorite another `model`. The simplest case is when the user will only be able to like/favorite another type of model, in which case this can be represented by a `Favorite` model which will reference a user and a liked model.

In this app I have implement a solution that will allow in the future to implement more models that can be liked/favorited by using a single polymorphic `favorites`table:

```bash
$ rails generate model favorite user:references favorited:references{polymorphic}
```

This creates the follwing migration:

```ruby
class CreateFavorites < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :favorites do |t|
      t.references :favorited, polymorphic: true, index: true
      t.references :user, index: true

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

And generates the following model:

```ruby
class Favorite < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :favorited, polymorphic: true
  belongs_to :user
end
```

Moving on to the user model, the following will allow to get all the favorites, but will also provide a way of returning just favorited pubs. This will come in handy later if we want to add other models to the favoriting system:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :favorites
  has_many :favorite_pubs, through: :favorites, source: :favorited, source_type: 'Pub'

  def likes?(pub)
    favorite_pubs.any? { |p| p.id == pub.id }
  end
end
```

I've also added an instance method `likes?(pub)` that receives a pub object and return `true`if the user has liked that pub and `false` otherwise.

I created a completely separate resource called `favorite_pubs`, but it is also possible to go with a more generic `favorites`controller. The routes will only provide for two actions: `create` and `destroy`.

I'll be submitting the requests with ajax, so the controller simply creates and destroys favorites as needed:

```ruby
class FavoritePubsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_pub

  def create
    Favorite.create(favorited: @pub, user: current_user)
  end

  def destroy
    Favorite.where(favorited_id: @pub.id, user_id: current_user.id).first.destroy
  end

  private

  def set_pub
    @pub = Pub.find(params[:pub_id])
  end
end
```

I'll be using FontAwesome icons, which should be full when liked (`fas` class) and empty otherwise (`far`class). I setup event listeners for `'click'` which toggle those classes on and off and submit the respective ajax requests to create or destroy the favorites in the backend as needed:

```javascript
import Rails from 'rails-ujs';

const toggleIcons = function() {
  const icons = document.querySelectorAll('.menu-content i')

  const toggleIcon = function(icon) {
    icon.classList.toggle('far');
    icon.classList.toggle('fas');
  }

  icons.forEach((icon) => {
    const pub = icon.closest('.card-row')
    const pubId = pub.id.split('-')[1]
    icon.addEventListener('click', () => {
      if (icon.classList.contains('far')) {
        fetch('/favorite_pubs', {
          method: 'post',
          body: JSON.stringify({pub_id: pubId}),
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-Token': Rails.csrfToken()
          },
          credentials: 'same-origin'
        }).then(function(response) {
          toggleIcon(icon);
        })

      } else if (icon.classList.contains('fas')) {
        fetch(`/favorite_pubs/${pubId}`, {
          method: 'delete',
          body: JSON.stringify({pub_id: pubId}),
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-Token': Rails.csrfToken()
          },
          credentials: 'same-origin'
        }).then(function(response) {
          toggleIcon(icon);
        })
      }
    })
  })
};

export {Â toggleIcons };

```

And finally setup the frontend with the logic to determine which lass should be applied by the backend on the first page load:

```erb
<li>
  <%= icon(current_user.likes?(pub) ? "fas" : "far" , "heart") %>
<li>
```
