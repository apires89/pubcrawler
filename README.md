# pubcrawlers mock app

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

This app is intended to showcase the implementation of some of the most common features used by Le Wagon students in their projects using webpacker and ES6 syntax as opposed to jQuery and the Asset Pipeline as recommended by the course curriculum.

It is not meant to be the end-all implementation solution for these features, but merely to be used as a reference tool, namely to the Le Wagon Lisbon teaching staff and others.

Live demo here https://pubcrawlerapp.herokuapp.com/

## Getting started

After cloning the app, create the db, run the migrations and seed.

```bash
$ rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

The seeds include addresses that will be geocoded. In order to take advantage of all of the features, make sure that all of the addresses were properly geocoded.

You can use an API key for [Google's Maps Geocoding API](https://console.developers.google.com)

```ruby
GOOGLE_API_SERVER_KEY: AIz*********************************TUZ
```

## Deploying to heroku

If deploying to heroku fails, it might be an issue with the webpacker version and you'll have to manually specify the heroku buildpacks:

```bash
$ heroku buildpacks:clear
$ heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby
```

## Adding Google Maps

For the basic setup I recommend following Le Wagon's [geocoding lecture](https://kitt.lewagon.com/knowledge/lectures/05-Rails%2F08-Airbnb-Geocoder)

However, unlike the lecture setup, *map.js* is a component and should go in the `app/javacript/components/` folder.

You can pass several options when creating the map, such as to disable `streetViewControl`, `mapTypeControl`and `scrollwheel`:

```javascript
const map = new GMaps({
  el: '#map',
  lat: 0, lng: 0,
  streetViewControl: false,
  mapTypeControl: false,
  scrollwheel:  false
});
```

To highlight markers on hovering over their corresponding card, you need to add an event listener to each card and dynamically change the marker when the event is fired:

```javascript
const cards = document.querySelectorAll('.card-row');
cards.forEach((card, index) => {
  const marker = mapMarkers[index];
  card.addEventListener('mouseover', () => {
    marker.setIcon('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Concept211/Google-Maps-Markers/master/images/marker_blue.png');
  });
  card.addEventListener('mouseout', () => {
    marker.setIcon('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Concept211/Google-Maps-Markers/master/images/marker_red.png');
  });
})
```

## Adding a Favoriting System

A `user`can like/favorite another `model`. The simplest case is when the user is only allowed to like/favorite instances from a single model, in which case this can be represented by a `Favorite` class which will reference a user and the liked model.

In this app I have implement a solution that allows for the future implementation of more models that can be liked/favorited by using a single polymorphic `favorites` table:

```bash
$ rails generate model favorite user:references favorited:references{polymorphic}
```

This creates the follwing migration:

```ruby
class CreateFavorites < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :favorites do |t|
      t.references :favorited, polymorphic: true, index: true
      t.references :user, index: true

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

And generates the following model:

```ruby
class Favorite < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :favorited, polymorphic: true
  belongs_to :user
end
```

Moving on to the user model, the following code allows us to get all the user favorites (from all likable models), but also provides a way of returning just the favorited pubs. This will come in handy later if we want to add other models to the favoriting system:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :favorites
  has_many :favorite_pubs, through: :favorites, source: :favorited, source_type: 'Pub'

  def likes?(pub)
    favorite_pubs.any? { |p| p.id == pub.id }
  end
end
```

I've also added an instance method `likes?(pub)` that receives a pub object and returns `true`if the user has liked that pub and `false` otherwise.

I created a completely separate resource called `favorite_pubs`, but it is also possible to go with a more generic `favorites` controller. The routes will only provide for two actions: `create` and `destroy`.

I'll be submitting the requests with ajax, so the controller simply creates and destroys favorites as needed:

```ruby
class FavoritePubsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_pub

  def create
    Favorite.create(favorited: @pub, user: current_user)
  end

  def destroy
    Favorite.where(favorited_id: @pub.id, user_id: current_user.id).first.destroy
  end

  private

  def set_pub
    @pub = Pub.find(params[:pub_id])
  end
end
```

I'm using FontAwesome icons, which should be full when liked (`fas` class) and empty otherwise (`far`class). I've setup event listeners for `'click'` which toggle those classes on and off and submit the relevant ajax request to create or destroy the favorites in the backend as needed:

```javascript
// pub.js

import Rails from 'rails-ujs';

const toggleIcons = function() {
  const icons = document.querySelectorAll('.menu-content i')

  const toggleIcon = function(icon) {
    icon.classList.toggle('far');
    icon.classList.toggle('fas');
  }

  icons.forEach((icon) => {
    const pub = icon.closest('.card-row')
    const pubId = pub.id.split('-')[1]
    icon.addEventListener('click', () => {
      if (icon.classList.contains('far')) {
        fetch('/favorite_pubs', {
          method: 'post',
          body: JSON.stringify({pub_id: pubId}),
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-Token': Rails.csrfToken()
          },
          credentials: 'same-origin'
        }).then(() => toggleIcon(icon))

      } else if (icon.classList.contains('fas')) {
        fetch(`/favorite_pubs/${pubId}`, {
          method: 'delete',
          body: JSON.stringify({pub_id: pubId}),
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'X-CSRF-Token': Rails.csrfToken()
          },
          credentials: 'same-origin'
        }).then(() => toggleIcon(icon))
      }
    })
  })
};

export {Â toggleIcons };
```

And finally setup the server side generated frontend with the logic to determine which class should be applied on the first page load:

```erb
<li>
  <%= icon(current_user.likes?(pub) ? "fas" : "far" , "heart") %>
<li>
```
